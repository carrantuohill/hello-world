# hello-world
First repository in Android Class

This is my first repository in GitHub.  I've used Panvalet and PVCS before for similar functions.  From what I remember, merging branches was one of the most dnagerous parts of this process.

I'm trying to restart my carreer with new Android skills after a failed attempt at a franchised business.  

I've never had moon tacos.  

All glory to God
